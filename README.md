# ACL

Artem's Classes/Components/Controls library (ACL).


Library contains number of classes, components and visual controls for Delphi that used in [AIMP](https://www.aimp.ru).
I have published the library because it was used in plugins that no longer supported by me.


If anyone will be interested the library I will add more information and create an index of all features and capabilities of the library.

Target platforms:
+ Delphi: Windows 32/64-bit
+ FPC: Linux  x86_64 via Gtk2

Tested on:
+ Delphi: 12.3 and 13
+ FPC: v3.3.1

The library may also work with other versions of Delphi/FPC.
